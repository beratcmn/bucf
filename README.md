# bucf
# Berat's Utility CSS Framework(ish)

bucf is like Tailwind, but less feature rich.
I'm trying to create a simple utility CSS Framework. 
bucf at it's core very simple but can be usefull in some situations. 
I create bucf around my needs and update according to that. I hope it can grow to a point to replicate my own website :P
