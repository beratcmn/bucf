# Berat's Utility CSS Framework(ish)

bucf is like Tailwind, but **less** feature rich.


# Who tho?

I'm trying to create a simple utility CSS Framework.  At some point it should cover all my basic CSS needs like Padding and Margins. I really need a basic handy tool.

## Is it any good?

Simply, **no.**
bucf at it's core very simple yet usefull in some situations. 
Currently it lacks a lot of the core features Tailwind has but it will get uptades, *eventually...* 


## Point is

I create bucf around my needs and update according to that. I hope it can grow to a point to replicate my own website :P
